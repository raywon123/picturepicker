## What it does:
This is a memeory game to help you improve your memory. 

The application render different images to the screen. The goal is to click as many pictures as you can without clicking the same picture. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

## How it works:
* It is a static REACT app. It does not have backend routing and it is purely frontend. It uses react-create-app template and deploy to GitHub pages. It also uses Bootstrap. In the src folder, the logic is in App.js and the components are Emoji, Counter, Title and Wrapper.

## Technology
* REACT

  
  ## Future Improvement:

* Need to work on the front end. Test.
